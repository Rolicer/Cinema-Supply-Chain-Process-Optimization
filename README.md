# Cinema Supply Chain Process Optimization

## Overview:
This project was part of an university course, where we had to model and simulate a supply chain process of the biggest cinema in Cologne (Germany) and analyze the outcomes to find improvements.

## Supply Chain Model:
The different Supply Chain Models represents events which occure from customers entering the cinema, waiting times for tickets and food & drinks from the snack bar and entering the cinema hall.

## Technologies used:
- **Data collection:** manual data entry by observing real world customers, their waiting time and other parameters
- **Data preprocessing & data analysis:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib & Seaborn)
- **Simulation modelling:** AnyLogic


## Lessons learned:
- How to represent a real world process in a digital application
- How to collect real world data and preprocess it for uses in other applications
- How simulation can help to find improvements in the exisitng supply chain processes
